 * Turns AI-written content into a playable project. The structure is fixed and

 * a walkthrough and send it back with a reason), which works in any domain.
 * Built-in projects may add the engineering track: the code of each version,
 * reviewed line by line, and a test the brief can ask for.
 *
 * Action and checklist ids are the ones the runtime and report rely on
 * ("call-grace", C1-C3, R4, ...). They are internal and never shown.

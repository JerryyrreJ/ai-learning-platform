 * What the AI writes for a generated project: content only. Every piece has a
 * named role (the problem, the rule that must not be broken, the scope, ...)
 * so the template can wire it into a fixed game structure. The AI never
 * chooses stages, actions, effects or endings.
 *
 * The roles mirror Harbour Clinic:
 *   problem      what really goes wrong, and the core thing the work must handle
 *   rule         a rule or constraint the client must not break
 *   scope        who it is for and what is out of scope
 *   detail       a useful detail that no requirement depends on
 *   environment  the tools or setting it has to work in
 *   success      how the client will judge success: a measurable target
